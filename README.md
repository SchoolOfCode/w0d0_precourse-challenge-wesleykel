# Tribute Page for Actor Chadwick Boseman 

I decided to do a tribute page for Chadwick as he life was unfortuateley  cut short due to cancer, he was only 2 years older than me but had achived so much in a short space of time.

I also wanted to show that he was more  than just the _"Black Panther"_ actor and had been working hard as an actor, writer and teacher for the past  20 years before he recived the main stream success with the **Black Panther Movie**.

## About this project.

I have previously completed this project when I started learning to code in the summer of 2020.

I remember although I could make the project pass the test, I wasn't completly satisfied with how basic the postioning and styling was so was happy to retry it a year later.

I decided to rather than create the page in the HTML file, to render the page using a  single Javascript function, I have been learning about Javascript(JS) modules and like this approach of using JS to render HTML when it's required.

Although this is simple webpage, I wanted the styling to be as clean and clear as  possible so chose a simple font and 2 colour, colour scheme.

I made the page responsive so it should look how I want it to looking  on a 27 inch monitor, 13 inch MacBook and an Iphone X or other large screen mobile phones.

I learnt how to set attributes to the  link using JS and also adding the Alt to the image using JS, other than it was pretty straight forward although could spend the week tweaking  it!
